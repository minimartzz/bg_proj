# Board Games Tracker

Starting a new project. Working with a friend to develop a web app that will help track the progress and performance of multiple players within a board game community. It aims to track both statistics of individual players game history but also global statistics about the community of players.

Alongside this, it will also serve as a repo for an "admin" to track the inventory of their games.

This project is largely inspired by my friends own Excel sheet tracker, and will be a simple project of mine to improve my development skills. Any feedback is welcome!
